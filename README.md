## Project Description

This project aims to create an Angular application for a food-related website. The application will have various features to showcase and search for different food items. Users will be able to view food items, search for specific foods, filter foods by tags, add items to a cart, and place orders.

Here is an overview of the major tasks involved in developing the project:

1. **Angular Application Setup**: Create the project folder and install Angular to set up the frontend application.

2. **Header Component**: Develop a header component that will be displayed on all pages of the application. This component will contain HTML markup and CSS styles to create an appealing and consistent header.

3. **Listing Foods**: Create a food model to represent food items and define their properties. Implement a data.ts file to store sample food data. This file will also include images of the food items stored in the assets folder. Develop a Food service to handle data retrieval and manipulation. Create the Home component, which will display the food items using HTML, TypeScript, and CSS.

4. **Search Functionality**: Enhance the application by adding a search feature. Implement a search method in the Food service to filter food items based on user input. Create a search route and display search results in the Home component. Generate a Search component to provide a dedicated search interface with its HTML, TypeScript, and CSS.

5. **Tags Functionality**: Extend the application to include tags for categorizing food items. Introduce a Tag model to represent tags and add sample tags to the data.ts file. Enhance the Food service to retrieve all tags and filter foods by selected tags. Implement a tags route and display tag results in the Home component. Generate a Tags component to provide a user interface for selecting tags and viewing associated food items.

6. **Food Page**: Develop a Food Page component to display detailed information about a specific food item. Add a method to the Food service to retrieve information about a particular food item. Configure routing to navigate to the Food Page component when a user selects a food item.

7. **Cart Functionality**: Implement a shopping cart feature that allows users to add food items to their cart. Create CartItem and Cart models to represent the cart and its items. Develop a Cart service to handle cart operations. Add a "Add to Cart" button on the Food Page component to enable users to add items to their cart. Generate a Cart Page component to display the cart items with options to modify quantities or remove items.

8. **User Authentication**: Introduce user authentication by creating a Login Page component. Implement login functionality using APIs and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Generate a User Service to handle user-related operations, including login and logout. Develop components for the Login Page, including input containers, input validation, text inputs, and a default button.

9. **Connect to MongoDB**: Connect the application to a MongoDB database to store food and user information. Utilize packages like Mongoose, bcryptjs, and express-async-handler to facilitate database operations. Migrate data from the data.ts file to the MongoDB database.

10. **Register User**: Implement a registration feature to allow users to create new accounts. Add a register API and corresponding service method. Create a Register Component to display the registration form and link it to the registration API.

11. **Checkout Page**: Create an Order model to represent orders placed by users. Develop a Checkout Page component where users can review their cart items, provide necessary information, and place orders. Save the order details using an Order Router and display the order status.

12. **Not Found Page**: Generate a Not Found component to display when users navigate to non-existent pages. Include this component in the Home Page, Food Page, and Cart Page to handle invalid routes.

This project aims to provide an interactive

 and user-friendly food website where users can explore and order their favorite food items.
